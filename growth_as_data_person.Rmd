## Growth as a Data Person

**Note:** Work in progress. I intend to continually update it as I make my progress on course objectives and complete my final project. I will also include any problems I've encountered while making my progress and how I overcame it. 

Over the past few years, I have been fascinated by data science and wanted to advance my career as a Data Scientist. Before taking this class, I had limited experience with data science, analytics, and data in general. Most of my experience comes from being a system engineer, where I had some programming experience in Python and Shell scripting that I use to automate manual tasks. 

I am exhilarated to be part of the STA 518 course, as it will allow me to expand on my programming and statistical skills. Throughout the course, I've learned quite a bit about R programming and performing statistical analysis using the raw data. I've discovered how to process raw data and manipulate them to extract the essential features that can summarize important facts.
