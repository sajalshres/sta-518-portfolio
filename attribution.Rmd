The [portfolio](https://sajalshres.github.io/sta-518-portfolio/) is developed as part of the requirement for [STA 518:  Statistical Computing and Graphics with R](https://dykesb.netlify.app/courses/sta518/) led by [Dr.Bradford Dykes](https://dykesb.netlify.app/).

Thank you Dr.Dykes for teaching and guiding me all about R programming.
